    Uranus, hating his monstrous children he incarcerated his children in Gaia (The earth). She couldnt bear the weight of her childen any longer so she cospired with her youngest Cronos to overthrow him.
    Gaia gave her younguest a silver sickle she crafted. When Uranus came to visit Gaia, Cronus ambushed his father, cut him to pieces and thew him into the sea which seperated the sky and the ocean. 
    From the sea foam came the goddess <b>Aphrodite</b> making her the oldest Olympian out of the main 12.
